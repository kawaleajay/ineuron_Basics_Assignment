                          ASSINGMENT - 2


1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
ans:-The two values of the Boolean data type are true and false.
     They can be written as value of expressions that have yes or no answers.
     it is used to represent the truth values of the expressions. For example, 1== 0 is True whereas 2>3 is False



2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
ans:- "AND","OR" And "NOT" it is the three diffrent type of boolean operators.


3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean
values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
ans:-

andlist = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]

print("\nThe AND operator truth table")
print(" A B AandB")
for i in andlist:
    print(i)

orlist = [[0,0,0][0,1,1][1,1,1]]

print("\nThe OR operator truth table")
print("A B AorB")
for in orlist:
    print(i)

notlist = [[0,1],[1,0]]

print("\nThe NOT operator truth table")
print("A noTA")
for i in range notlist:
    print(i)




4. What are the values of the following expressions?
ans:-
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)                  >>False<<
not (5 > 4)                           >>False<<
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)                   >>True<<
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))             >>False<<
(True and True) and (True == False)   >>False<<
(not False) or (not True)             >>True<<

1) (True) and (False) = False
2) not(True)          = False
3) (True) or (False)  = True
4) (True) and (False) = False
5) (True) or (False)  = True



5. What are the six comparison operators?
ans:-
(1) ==  -> Equal 
(2) !=  -> Not equal
(3) >   -> Greater than
(4) <   -> Less than
(5) >=  -> Greater than or equal to
(6) <=  -> Less than or equal to



6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a
condition and when you would use one.
ans:-
Assignment operator "="
It is an assignment operator.
It is used for assigning the value to a variable.
example a = 11, str = "ineuron" 
Constant term cannot be placed on left hand side.
Ex:-1=a; is invalid.

Equal to Operator "=="
It is a relational or comparison operator
It is used for comparing two values. It returns 1 if both the values are equal otherwise returns 0.
Constant term can be placed in the left hand side.
Example: 1==1 is valid and returns 1.

example :

a=11
b=11

if a==b:
    print("True")
else:
    print("False")



7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')

ans:-

spam = 0
if spam == 10:
    print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
    print('bacon')
else:
    print('ham')
    print('spam')
    print('spam')



8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints
Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
ans:-
spam=int(input())
if spam==1:
    print("hello")
elif spam==2:             << Example - 1
    print("Howdy")
else:
    print("Gretting!")

spam=int(input())
if spam==1:
    print("hello")
if spam==2:              << Example - 2
    print("howdy")
else:
    print("grettings")




9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?

ans:- I will press ctrl+c.



10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
ans:-   
Break=   The diffrence between break and continue statment is used for immediate termination of loop.
         The Break statement is used to exit from the loop constructs.
Continue=continue statement perform again and again whenever condition is true.



11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
ans:- in a for loop range function in Python takes 3 arguments and they are initial value, final value and increment value.
      There  is a no diffrence between range.

for i in range(10):
    print(i)

for i in range(0,10):
    print(i)

for i in range(0,10,1):
    print(i)



12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent
program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
ans:-
for i in range(1 , 11):
    print(i)

a=1
while(True):
    if a<=10:
        print(a)
        a=a+1



13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after
importing spam?
ans:-
import spam
a = spam.bacon()
