# 1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be
# integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.

# (*):-Expression

# ('hello') :- String

# (-87.8) :-Value

# (-) :- Expression

# (/) :- Expression

# (+) :- Expression

# (6) :- Value



# 2. What is the difference between string and variable?
# ans:-(1)a string is a value representing text.A string is written between quotes("").
#      (2)a variable is a name that can refer to any value.
#         variable can be of several types like integer, floating point,string,boolean.
#         in the code example we have an integer,string and boolean.All of these of variables.
#         String is just a type of variable. Pythons dectes the type of variable automatically.




# 3. Describe three different data types.
# ans:-(1)Integer:Integer is the data type to store the only number and  numeric value.
#      (2)String:A string data type is a combination of characters that can be either constant or variable.
#      (3)Boolean:Boolean data is what programmers use to show logic in code. It is typically one of two values—true or false—intended to clarify conditional statements.
#         Boolean – (True or False) Boolean type provides two built-in values, True or False Set – set Sequence type – string, list, tuple.



# 4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?
#  ans:- expression made up of combination of operators, constants and variables. 
#        if there is more than one operator in an expression, their precedence decides which operation will be performed first.



# 5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an
# expression and a statement?
# ans:-An expression evaluates to a single value. A statement does not.
#      The statement is just like a command that a python interpreter executes like print.


# 6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
# bacon = 22
# bacon + 1
# ans:- 
# bacon=22
# bacon=bacon+1
# print(bacon)  #It gives 23 as execution code.


# 7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
# 'spam' + 'spamspam'
# 'spam' * 3
# ans:-Both will give the same result as 'spamspamspam'.


# 8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?
# ans:-Because 100 is an integer value. and we cant start variable as the integer value.
#      Eg. 100, 100e, 100eggs its invalid.but egges100, e100 is the valid.


# 9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string
# version of a value?
# ans:-int(), float(), string()


# 10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
# 'I have eaten'+ 99 +'burritos.'
# ans:-
 a='I have eaten + 99 + burritos.'
 print(a)
